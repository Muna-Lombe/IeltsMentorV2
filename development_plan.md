### Phase 1: Core Bot Infrastructure & Basic User Interaction

**Goals:**
*   Establish the foundational project structure and essential services.
*   Implement basic user registration and interaction via the Telegram bot.
*   Set up core database models and initial multi-language support.

**Key Features/Modules:**
*   Project boilerplate (Flask, SQLAlchemy, `python-telegram-bot`).
*   Database setup and core `User` model.
*   `/start` command for user registration, language detection.
*   Basic translation system.
*   Initial logging and error handling framework.
*   Environment configuration (`.env`, `requirements.txt`).

**Task Checklist:**
*   [ ] **Project Setup:**
    *   [ ] Initialize Git repository.
    *   [ ] Set up Python virtual environment.
    *   [ ] Install core dependencies (Flask, SQLAlchemy, `python-telegram-bot`, psycopg2-binary).
    *   [ ] Create initial `requirements.txt`.
    *   [ ] Define project structure (folders for `handlers`, `models`, `services`, `utils`, `static`, `templates`, `data`, `migrations` as per `project_guide.md`).
    *   [ ] Configure `.env` file for essential variables (DATABASE_URL, TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, FLASK_SECRET_KEY - see `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`).
*   [ ] **Database Setup:**
    *   [ ] Define `User` model (`id`, `user_id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `username`, `joined_at`, `is_admin` (for teacher flag), `is_botmaster`, `preferred_language`) based on `project_guide.md` and `project_rules.md` (schema consistency).
    *   [ ] Implement initial database migration script (e.g., using Flask-Migrate or custom as per `migrations.py` in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`).
    *   [ ] Create `database_manager.py` utility for basic DB operations.
*   [ ] **Telegram Bot Integration:**
    *   [ ] Initialize Flask app and `python-telegram-bot` dispatcher.
    *   [ ] Implement `/start` command handler:
        *   [ ] Check if user exists.
        *   [ ] If new user, create `User` record in the database.
        *   [ ] Perform basic language detection (from `update.effective_user.language_code` or default).

    *   [ ] Review incident response plan.
*   [ ] **Performance Optimization:**
    *   [ ] Profile database queries and optimize slow ones (add indexes, rewrite queries).
    *   [ ] Implement caching strategies (session, query results, translations as per `project_guide.md` - Performance Optimization).
    *   [ ] Optimize static asset delivery for the web interface.
*   [ ] **Translation System Finalization:**
    *   [ ] Ensure all user-facing strings in the bot and web interface are managed by the translation system.
    *   [ ] Complete translations for all supported languages (as per `project_guide.md`).
    *   [ ] Test language switching and automatic detection thoroughly.
*   [ ] **Deployment Preparation (as per `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`):**
    *   [ ] Finalize Dockerfile and Docker Compose setup.
    *   [ ] Prepare Nginx configuration for reverse proxy, SSL, and rate limiting.
    *   [ ] Create Systemd service file for Gunicorn.
    *   [ ] Develop database backup strategy and script (`backup.sh`).
    *   [ ] Implement health check endpoint (`/health` as per `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`).
    *   [ ] Update `.env.example` with all required production variables.
*   [ ] **Documentation Review:**
    *   [ ] Ensure all `project_rules.md` have been adhered to.
    *   [ ] Review and update `API_REFERENCE.md` to match final implementation.
    *   [ ] Review and update `SECURITY_GUIDE.md` and `TESTING_GUIDE.md`.

    *   [ ] Ensure `/help` command in the bot provides comprehensive assistance.
    *   [ ] Complete `project_guide.md` with details of the final architecture and features.
    *   [ ] Finalize `botmaster_guide.md`.
    *   [ ] Update `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with common issues found during testing and their solutions.
    *   [ ] Ensure `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` is accurate and complete for production setup.
*   [ ] **Production Deployment:**
    *   [ ] Set up production server environment (OS, Database, Redis if used).
    *   [ ] Configure DNS, SSL certificates.
    *   [ ] Deploy application using Docker or Systemd service.
    *   [ ] Run database migrations in production.
    *   [ ] Set Telegram bot webhook to production URL.
    *   [ ] Perform final smoke tests on the production environment.
*   [ ] **Launch Activities:**
    *   [ ] Announce bot availability (if applicable).
    *   [ ] (Optional) Prepare communication for initial users/teachers.
*   [ ] **Post-Launch Monitoring & Support:**
    *   [ ] Actively monitor application logs (error rates, performance).
    *   [ ] Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk).
    *   [ ] Monitor database performance.
    *   [ ] Be prepared to address bugs and critical issues promptly.
    *   [ ] Collect user feedback for future improvements.
    *   [ ] Regularly perform database backups.
    *   [ ] Schedule regular security updates for OS and dependencies.

## 4. Cross-Cutting Concerns (Applicable Throughout Development)

*   **Version Control:** Commit changes frequently with clear messages. Use branches for feature development.
*   **Code Quality:** Follow PEP 8 and project-specific coding conventions. Keep code DRY and well-commented where necessary (non-obvious parts).
*   **Regular Testing:** Run relevant tests after implementing new features or making significant changes.
*   **Security First:** Continuously consider security implications of new features and data handling (refer to `SECURITY_GUIDE.md` and Rule 2 in `project_rules.md`).
*   **Documentation Updates:** Keep relevant documentation (`API_REFERENCE.md`, `project_guide.md`, etc.) updated as the project evolves.
*   **Adherence to `project_rules.md`:** Regularly review and ensure all development work complies with the established rules.
*   **Regular Backups (Development DB):** Ensure the development database can be easily restored if needed.

This development plan provides a structured approach to building the IELTS Preparation Bot. Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for iterative development and testing. Regular review of this plan and the associated project documentation will be crucial for success.
